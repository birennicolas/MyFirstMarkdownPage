## **Nicolas Biren, Electrician**

I am a 28 years old electrician who decided to make a change in his life by joining BeCode to become as a junior web developper. I worked essentially in the residential sector and it was hard labour affecting my physical health. I've witnessed many of my coworkers fall from 8m ladders and I've personally experienced watching an 125 amps electricity board explode in front of me💥. I liked the technical part of the job and finding solutions to solve problems, which I can also find as a web developer.
